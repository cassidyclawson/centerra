        <h3>Paul Draper</h3>
        <h4>President &amp; CEO</h4>
        <p>Paul is Centerra Capital’s founder and principal dealmaker. He works closely with a diverse mix of ambitious clients to overcome business challenges and get deals done. Since 1998, Paul and his team at Centerra Capital have allocated more than a billion dollars in financing and moved millions of square-feet of property across California and Oregon. He practices the craft of finance with equal parts discipline and creativity.</p>
        <p>Paul is a lifelong resident of California’s Stanislaus County. He presently serves as a member of the Board of Trustees of Sutter Gould Medical Foundation and a Trustee of the Gallo Center for the Arts. Paul is thankful that his professional efforts have meaningful impact in his community, as seen in the success of developments like 1020 Tenth Street, a 32,000 sf Class A office building in the heart of Modesto.</p>
        <p>Paul’s professional history includes decades of management experience for middle-market companies. His accomplishments span the sectors of finance, agriculture, food-processing and technology. Paul partnered in a joint venture that successfully moved a major food processor into the California nut-industry. He was also instrumental in bringing two major technological innovations to agriculture: enterprise data processing software in the 1970s, and drip irrigation in the early 1980s.</p>

        <p class="footnote">Paul graduated with honors from the University of California, Davis in Agricultural Economics and Business Management and holds a Masters Degree in Business Administration from Harvard University.</p>
