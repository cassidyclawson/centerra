        <h3>Capital Formation</h3>
        <h5>Centerra helps your business thrive by providing timely access to capital. We work across industries and assist clients with a wide range of strategic objectives, including investment for new ventures, growth financing, and restructuring of existing debt to increase corporate value. </h5>
        <h5>We are deeply connected in the Central Valley investment community and maintain a broad network of global financiers and lenders. You’ll benefit from our longstanding relationships with regional and national banks, investment banks, insurance companies, securitized lenders, mezzanine lenders, private equity funds, and high net-worth individuals. We ensure that you raise capital with the right partners and at the lowest possible cost.</h5>

        <h4>EARLY STAGE FUNDRAISING</h4>
        <div class="indent">
          <p>Centerra Capital can help your early-stage company raise money to scale a proven business model. Advisory services include preparation of business materials and financial forecasts for potential investors, structuring of debt or equity-based investment vehicles, and introduction to appropriate funders from our network.</p>
          <p>Though we can only work with a handful of early-stage companies per year, we consider this an exciting part of our practice and enjoy forming partnerships with innovative startups, especially in AgTech.</p>
        </div>

        <h4>GROWTH CAPITAL</h2>
        <div class="indent">
          <p>Is your company positioned to take advantage of a transformative opportunity? Perhaps you could accelerate growth by leasing new equipment, buying property or acquiring a competitor. But you need capital, and more than is available from conventional banks and lenders.</p>
          <p>Centerra Capital helps small and middle-market businesses secure cash infusions for growth. We assist our clients in vetting their business opportunities, evaluating potential sources of financing, and negotiating the terms of the deal.</p>
          <p>Our team is experienced, creative, and fluent in a wide-range of deal structures. We routinely complete deals in the form of senior debt, mezzanine debt, growth equity and hybrid vehicles.</p>
        </div>

        <h4>REFINANCING</h4>
        <div class="indent">
          <p>Sometimes the best way to raise capital is to restructure existing debts. You can free up cash, reduce monthly payments or change your risk profile (e.g. switching from a variable-rate to a fixed-rate loan). We can analyze your balance sheet and help facilitate a profitable debt refinancing or consolidation program.</p>

        <h3>Advisory Services</h3>
        <h5>We do more than raise money. Our advisors can help generate value across the entire spectrum of corporate work, including mergers and acquisitions, expansions, joint ventures, divestments and restructurings, as well as routine issues of corporate governance. We combine exceptional transactional skills with specialist expertise in real estate, agriculture and manufacturing.</h5>

        <h4>SELLING YOUR BUSINESS</h4>
        <div class="indent">
          <p>Whether you have already been approached, or are contemplating a sale down the line, we can help groom your business to maximize exit value. And when you’re ready, we work closely with your executives and board to prepare an M&amp;A plan, market your business to interested parties, prepare your sales memorandum, negotiate the price and help you close the deal successfully.</p>
          <p>The sale of a closely-held business poses unique challenges. We can help you and your family handle complex tax and succession issues to ensure wealth is preserved for generations to come.</p>
        </div>

        <h4>BUYING A BUSINESS</h4>
        <div class="indent">
          <p>Growing your business often requires the acquisition of competitors or complementary companies. Perhaps you need to expand your geographic reach, acquire hard-to-get customers or assets, or position your business for a larger sale. We can help you navigate the acquisition lifecycle and realize the expected value of the transaction.</p>
          <p>Centerra Capital assists clients with development of an acquisition strategy, sourcing of capital to fund the transaction, identification of takeover targets, negotiation of price, and ultimately, completion of the deal. We then help you navigate the complex tax, personnel and property issues that arise when combining operations, with the goal of maximizing your return on investment.</p>
